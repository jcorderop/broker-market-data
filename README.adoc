== MarketDataService Project Description:

image::MarketDataService.PNG[]

* MarketDataService is used to normalize prices from BitMex and Binance to internal quotes.
- It has a client websocket that connects to BitMEX and Binance.
* Internal quotes are published via websocket. To subcribe to internal prices go to section *Websocket MarketDataService Test*.
* Data received is sent via vertx bus to 3 topics:
- Vertx event bus:

    Topic: raw_data
        * raw quotes recevied from BitMex are logged asynchronous for audit

* Quotes are normalized into a Google Proto Buffer object and this object is sent to a different topic simultaneously:
- Vertx event bus:

   Topic: internal_quotes
        1) The Quote proto received is converted to json
        2) WebsocketServerVerticle, this component publish the mesages to clients
        subscribed for internal use
        3) The Quote proto is sent to be storage after the publish time is added

   Topic: storage
        1) StorageVerticle stores in database the quote using JPA/Entity

== Grafana Dashboard

* Once the docker is deployed, use admin/admin to login

=== Datasource configuration

* Go to setting -> Configuration -> Data sources -> Add DataSource
* Search for Postgresql

    Host: database:5432
    Database: marketdata
    User/Password: defined in the yaml file
    TLS/SSL Mode: disable

* Save and test

=== Import Dashboard

* On create (+) -> Import
* Under the new window -> Upload Json file
* Go to

    <WORKSPACE>/grafana/DashboardQuotes.json

* Load
* It will crate the dashboard Quotes as follows:

- First section shows max latency in ms per second
- Second section shows number of quotes per second

IMPORTANT: If you run Grafana and Posgresql inside Docker and the MarketdataService in your local PC, the time is shift the timezone

=== Grafana help

* https://grafana.com/docs/[Grafana.com]

== Project Build

=== Building

* Go to <WORKSPACE>/

* To launch the tests:

    mvn clean test

* To package the application:

    mvn clean package

* To run/stop the application:

    mvn spring-boot:run
    mvn spring-boot:stop

* To build a new docker image:

    mvn spring-boot:build-image

IMPORTANT: If you run the service locally, you have to deploy PostgreSql first, for more details go to dockers section.

== BitMEX API:

* The service subscribes to BitMEX topic "instrument" and updates are received via Websockets:

    https://www.bitmex.com/app/wsAPI

* Connection to:

    wss://www.bitmex.com/realtime

* Topic:

    "instrument",          // Instrument updates including turnover and bid/ask

* To manage the configuration of the topics it can be changed in the file:

    broker-marketdata/src/main/resources/application.ymal

* In to the property definition:

    ws.client.bitmex.symbol

=== BitMex API Help

* https://www.bitmex.com/app/apiOverview[Bitmex]

== Binance API:

* The service subscribes to Binance stream "bookTicker" and updates are received via Websockets:

    wss://stream.binance.com:9443

* Connection to:

    wss://stream.binance.com:9443/ws

* Stream:

    @bookTicker

* To manage the configuration of the topics it can be changed in the file:

    broker-marketdata/src/main/resources/application.ymal

* In to the property definition:

    ws.client.binance.symbol

== Google Protocol Buffers 

=== Building

To build InternalPrice.proto:

* Add the environment variable PROTOC_PATH where protoc in installed.
* Go to terminal in the project and execute

    .\build_protoc.bat

* It will create the relevant classes for InternalPrice.
* InternalPrice is the serialized object that will be sent.
* For debugging, you can set the variable serialization:false in the config file

=== Google Protocol Buffers Help

* https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/javatutorial[Google Protocol Buffer]

== Storage

* Uses PostgreSql to store prices as docker image
* Uses flyway as a database management control

== Docker-compose

=== Building

To deploy the MarketDataService with PostgreSql

* Go to <WORKSPACE>/docker-compose/marketdata
* execute

    docker-compose up -d

To deploy only PostgreSql

* Go to <WORKSPACE>/docker-compose/postgresql
* execute

    docker-compose up -d

=== Docker Help

* https://docs.docker.com/[Docker.com]

== Websocket MarketDataService Test

=== Online client

Once the service is running locally or in a container

* to test the websocket connect using

    https://websocketking.com/
    https://www.piesocket.com/websocket-tester#

* use the following path

    ws://localhost:8900/realtime/quotes


== New features added

=== Branch "grafana":

* Added Grafana
- Added Grafana as part of marketdata docker-compose
- go to section Grafana and follow the instruction to set-up and import the dashboard
- the dashboard shows max latency in ms per second and quotes per second
* General enhancements
- To reduce Verticles, WebsocketClientVerticle changed to abstract
- Added abstract test classes to simplify code
- Refactored configuration and making database configuration immutable
- Publish time now is part of the protoc quote and the quote is stored in progress after the published time is added
- Latency is removed when the quote is publish and now grafana is used for visualization
- Symbol configuration was changed to map and normalize from exchanges to internal same symbols

=== Branch "binance":

* Added Binance
- Refactor the Websocket client in order to be reusable
- Created the concept of adapter for Binance and BitMEX
- Split Configuration and quotes Normalization by adapter
- Added unit test for Binance

=== Branch "springboot-vertx":

* Introduced Spring Boot
- Used to simplify code injecting instances, configuration and constructors.
- Simplify configuration.
- Reduce dependencies in POM.
- Verticles are independent and keep communicating asynchronously via the Vertx-Bus.
- JPA+Hibernate to handle the storage.
- Given the amount of quotes that can be stored the database is drop every restart during dev time.
- Added H2 for the unit test.
- Added latency measurement from the time the tick arrives to when it is published, subscribe to ws://localhost:8900/realtime/quotes.
* Original Vertx code in branch "vertx"
