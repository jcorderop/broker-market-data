* MarketDataService is used to normalize prices from BitMex to internal quotes.
* It has a client websocket that connects to BitMex.
* Data received is sent via vertx bus to two topics:

    Topic: raw_data
        * raw quotes recevied from BitMex are logged asynchronous for audit

* Quotes are normalized into a Google Proto Buffer object and this object is sent to a different topic simultaneously:

   Topic: internal_quotes
        * Two components are reading from this topic
        1) StorageVerticle that stores the internal normilized prices
        2) WebsocketServerVerticle, this component publish the mesages to clients
        subscribed for internal use

== BitMEX API:

* The service subscribes to BitMEX topic "instrument" and updates are received via Websockets:

    https://www.bitmex.com/app/wsAPI

* Connection to:

    wss://www.bitmex.com/realtime

* Topic:

    "instrument",          // Instrument updates including turnover and bid/ask

* To manage the configuration of the topics it can be changed in the file:

    broker-marketdata/src/main/resources/application.ymal

* In to the property definition:

    ws.client.symbol

This application was generated using http://start.vertx.io

=== Building

* Go to <WORKSPACE>/broker_marketdata/

* To launch your tests:

    ./mvnw clean test

* To package your application:

    ./mvnw clean package

* To run your application:

./mvnw clean compile exec:java
IMPORTANT: If you run the service locally, you have to deploy PostgreSql first, for more details go to dockers secions.

== Google Protocol Buffers

=== Building

To build InternalPrice.proto:

* Add the environment variable PROTOC_PATH where protoc in installed.
* Go to terminal in the project and execute

    .\build_protoc.bat

* It will create the relevant classes for InternalPrice.
* InternalPrice is the serialized object that will be sent.
* For debugging you can set the variable serialization:false in the config file

== Storage

* Uses PostgreSql to store prices as docker image
* Uses flyway as a database management control

== Docker-compose

=== Building

To deploy the MarketDataService with PostgreSql

* Go to <WORKSPACE>/broker_marketdata/cocker-compose/marketdata
* execute

    docker-compose up -d

To deploy the MarketDataService with PostgreSql

* Go to <WORKSPACE>/broker_marketdata/cocker-compose/postgresql
* execute

    docker-compose up -d

== Websocket MarketDataService Test

=== Online client

Once the service is running locally or in a container

* to test the websocket connect using

    https://websocketking.com/
    https://www.piesocket.com/websocket-tester#

* use the following path

    ws://localhost:8900/realtime/quotes
